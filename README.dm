Class: CAS 522 Dynamical Systems

This folder contains didactic material for the students of 'CAS 522 Dynamical Systems'.
Come back at the end of each module, for sample solutions to the coding problems.

Module 2 | Random Networks
Required Packages: Numpy, Random, PyVis 
Goals: In this module you will learn how to generate and visualize random networks. You will also learn how to extract information from an adjacency matrix, and calculate the clustering coefficient of a random network.

Module 3 | Systems of ODEs with ScyPy
Required Packages: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
Goals: In this module you will learn how to use ScyPy to numerically solve systems of normal and ordinary differential equations.

Module 4 | Difference Equations & Iteration
Required Packages: Matplotlib
Goals: In this module you will learn how to generate time series iteratively, and how to visualize them using Matplotlib.

Module 5 | Linear Systems of Equations and Absorbing Markov Chains
Required Packages: Numpy, PyVis, SymPy
Goals: Solve linear systems of equations symbolically, and use this technique to solve absorbing Markov Chains.
